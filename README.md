# Financial News Sentiment Analysis
The Financial News Sentiment Analysis project utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to analyze the sentiment in financial news articles. The tool aims to predict market trends by capturing the emotional tone of news reports, providing valuable insights for investors and financial institutions. By classifying news articles as positive, negative, or neutral, the tool acts as a market sentiment indicator, and early warning system, and enhances investment strategies and risk management. The project explores various models, including Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The CNN model stands out with the highest accuracy and F1-Score, effectively capturing semantic meanings in texts. Future improvements include advanced models and expanded datasets. This tool aims to revolutionize investment decision-making by offering deeper insights into market sentiment, aiding investors and financial institutions in navigating market trends more strategically.
